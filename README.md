# Summer-Challenge-Topic-Modelling
## Problem Statement:
**Design an interactive GUI using topic modelling** <br>
On arXiv (https://arxiv.org/), the first two papers related to research on coronavirus were submitted in November 2013 and December 2014 respectively, and the third paper was submitted in November 2016 (revised in April 2019). Now, since December 2019, over 250 papers have been submitted, and as it appears many more are going to come (arXiv has now created a new COVID-19 quick search: https://arxiv.org/covid19search). To analyse the evolution of the (top few) (textual) topics over time (as more and more papers come on this), design an interactive GUI that would use an advanced topic-modelling technique at the backend.

## Requirements:
* Django 2.1.2
* Pyrebase
* nltk
* xhtml2pdf
